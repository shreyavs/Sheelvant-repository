## Education in India

### Outline

##### Summary
Despite having a wide range of skills, Indians believe that Engineering, Law, and Medicine are the only ways to make a living.

##### Understanding the Audiance
The target audience of my final project is students, parents, and the government. Each user's needs and how they can be addressed are shown below.
1. As a student, I want to know how lucrative other career opportunities are, so that, I can make an informed decision about my future. I can do this by educating myself on the different options available to me.
2. As a parent, I want to know how lucrative other career opportunities are, so that, I can help my child make an informed decision about their future. I can do this by educating myself on the different options available to my child.
3. As a government official, I want to promote diversity in educational programs so that India can evolve into a developed country by harnessing the diverse skillset of our citizens. I can accomplish this by making lesser-known educational programs available to students.

##### Project Structure
A large majority of educational programs in India focus on engineering, law, and medical, but there are other lucrative career options that lack a good educational medium. At this stage, variety in educational institutions is critical.

##### Project Description
My project will draw attention to the disparities in educational programs in India. It will include data on employment rates and incomes after graduation, educational programs in other countries, varied skills of students, as well as information on the reasons for this, societal expectations, and trends over time. The purpose of the project is to persuade the audience of the importance of varied professional paths and educational programs.


### Initial sketches

##### Story Arc
Based on my story, the emotional reactions I expect from the audience are depicted in the story arc below. I've highlighted the types of data I'd like to provide at each point of the story, as well as some suggestions from my peers.

##### Rough Skecthes
Here are some of the rough sketches of charts I will be including in the final project:

I'll be using this unit chart to show the incomes of various job titles to demonstrate that there are alternative lucrative career options.

I'll be using this bar chart to demonstrate the decline in employment diversity over time.

I'll be using this world map as a heat map to highlight which countries have educational heterogeneity while talking about how these countries are performing financially.

I'll be using this pie chart to demonstrate the disparity in the proportion of universities catering to distinct educational disciplines.

I'll be using this line chart along with other charts on mental health to show the increasing trend in unhappy employees to draw a connection between lack of passion and poor mental health.

### The Data

Information: This pdf provides information about the budget for different educational programs declared by the Indian government. I will use this data in a chart to show how most of the educational budget is sectioned out for only a few fields.

Information: This pdf contains the results of a detailed survey of education in India. I will be using this data to compare student enrollment rates, differences in the number of colleges/programs available.

Information: This website provides wage statistics after completing a degree. I will update and use this chart in my study to highlight that different professional routes are equally lucrative.

Information: This document contains information on the skillset gap in each workforce. I will use these figures to demonstrate the absence of specialization in educational programs.


### The Medium
I plan to create rough sketches of the story and the charts using pen and paper and remake them on a digital platform for the final project. I will use Shorthand to visualize my story and Flourish and Tableau to create the graphics required for the visualization.

To complete the final project, I will be doing the following:
1. I'll be gathering more data for the various segments of the story arc.
2. After gathering sufficient data, I will evaluate the story arc and make necessary changes.
3. I'll sketch out rough visualizations for each section of the narrative.
4. I'll build the narrative with the visualizations to effectively represent the story I want to tell.
5. I'll gather feedback from my peers and others.
6. I'll incorporate the proposed changes.
7. I'll make a digital copy of the charts and sketches.
8. I'll create a storyboard in Shorthand integrating these visualizations and the narrative.
9. I'll gather feedback from my peers and others.
10. I'll incorporate the proposed changes.
