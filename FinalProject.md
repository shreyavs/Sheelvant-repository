#### Outline

##### Summary
Despite having a wide range of skills, Indians believe that Engineering, Law, and Medicine are the only ways to make a living.

##### Understanding the Audiance
The target audience of my final project is students, parents, and the government. Each user's needs and how they can be addressed are shown below.
1. As a student, I want to know how lucrative other career opportunities are, so that, I can make an informed decision about my future. I can do this by educating myself on the different options available to me.
2. As a parent, I want to know how lucrative other career opportunities are, so that, I can help my child make an informed decision about their future. I can do this by educating myself on the different options available to my child.
3. As a government official, I want to promote diversity in educational programs so that India can evolve into a developed country by harnessing the diverse skillset of our citizens. I can accomplish this by making lesser-known educational programs available to students.

##### Project Structure
A large majority of educational programs in India focus on engineering, law, and medical, but there are other lucrative career options that lack a good educational medium. At this stage, variety in educational institutions is critical.

##### Project Description
My project will draw attention to the disparities in educational programs in India. It will include data on employment rates and incomes after graduation, educational programs in other countries, varied skills of students, as well as information on the reasons for this, societal expectations, and trends over time. The purpose of the project is to persuade the audience of the importance of varied professional paths and educational programs.
