##### Critique
Overall, I would say this chart is a good visualization. The chart provides relevant information. The title of the chart is clear and to the point. The context of the chart is set by the title so we can easily see how the bar charts increase in size showing the user that these mental health issues have become more prominent during the pandemic. It shows data recorded during 3 different time periods, before and during the pandemic, providing enough evidence to support the objective of the chart. The chart is aesthetic, easy to understand, and clearly communicates the intended information. It uses distinguished colors, has grey text to show less important information, and has the X-axis text center-aligned giving it a clean and professional look.
However, there is some room for improvement. The chart does display useful information but not entirely. It has a lot of text, the labels have repetitive information like % and Symptoms of X disorder, making the chart look cluttered. Even if the user reads the title and then observes the chart, what the colors of the bars represent is a little unclear. Since we are used to seeing the timeline on the X-axis, this chart may require the user to constantly check the legend. The same information is represented in different colors to differentiate the timeline, this might be misleading as the user might think that these bars relate to 3 different topics. The different colors also make it hard for the user to focus on one thing.
The data represented by the chart is valid but not entirely accurate. The chart intends to show the increase in the number of anxiety and depression cases since the pandemic has started, claiming that the pandemic is the reason behind the spike. The pandemic might have been one of the causes for the rise in cases but not necessarily the sole reason. During the pandemic, people lost their loved ones, faced financial constraints, were quarantined for long periods of time, lost their jobs and their social lives. All these issues are interrelated, and each person may have a different reason for having anxiety or depression. Although all these are valid reasons, since the pandemic has started, people have inevitably started spending more time on social media. Many reports have proven that social media has a significant impact on mental health. It is possible that a major reason for the rise in numbers is the rise in the use of social media. This might be the causal effect of the pandemic, but it is possible that once the pandemic is over, these numbers are still high because people are still using social media. It would be misleading to say that the pandemic caused the spike in numbers.  Another issue with the chart is, the time when data was recorded is inconsistent. The first data point is in January - June 2019, the second is in May 2020 and the last one is in Dec 2020. Since the gap between the first 2 data points is larger, the growth in numbers is also larger when compared to the last two data points. The difference in height of the bar charts clearly shows the difference in growth in numbers. This might be misleading as the user might think that there has been a sudden spike when they compare the first two bars. In addition to that, the chart also shows limited data points. It would be helpful to show the spike in numbers from Nov 2019 (when the pandemic started) and Feb 2020 (a few months into the pandemic). This information would also tell the user if there was a sudden surge or if this was a gradual increase.
