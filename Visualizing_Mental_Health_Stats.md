#### Critique
Overall, I would say this chart is a good visualization. The chart provides relevant information. The title of the chart is clear and to the point. The context of the chart is set by the title so we can easily see how the bar charts increase in size showing the user that these mental health issues have become more prominent during the pandemic. It shows data recorded during 3 different time periods, before and during the pandemic, providing enough evidence to support the objective of the chart. The chart is aesthetic, easy to understand, and clearly communicates the intended information. It uses distinguished colors, has grey text to show less important information, and has the X-axis text center-aligned giving it a clean and professional look.
However, there is some room for improvement. The chart does display useful information but not entirely. It has a lot of text, the labels have repetitive information like % and Symptoms of X disorder, making the chart look cluttered. Even if the user reads the title and then observes the chart, what the colors of the bars represent is a little unclear. Since we are used to seeing the timeline on the X-axis, this chart may require the user to constantly check the legend. The same information is represented in different colors to differentiate the timeline, this might be misleading as the user might think that these bars relate to 3 different topics. The different colors also make it hard for the user to focus on one thing.
The data represented by the chart is valid but not entirely accurate. The chart intends to show the increase in the number of anxiety and depression cases since the pandemic has started, claiming that the pandemic is the reason behind the spike. The pandemic might have been one of the causes for the rise in cases but not necessarily the sole reason. During the pandemic, people lost their loved ones, faced financial constraints, were quarantined for long periods of time, lost their jobs and their social lives. All these issues are interrelated, and each person may have a different reason for having anxiety or depression. Although all these are valid reasons, since the pandemic has started, people have inevitably started spending more time on social media. Many reports have proven that social media has a significant impact on mental health. It is possible that a major reason for the rise in numbers is the rise in the use of social media. This might be the causal effect of the pandemic, but it is possible that once the pandemic is over, these numbers are still high because people are still using social media. It would be misleading to say that the pandemic caused the spike in numbers.  Another issue with the chart is, the time when data was recorded is inconsistent. The first data point is in January - June 2019, the second is in May 2020 and the last one is in Dec 2020. Since the gap between the first 2 data points is larger, the growth in numbers is also larger when compared to the last two data points. The difference in height of the bar charts clearly shows the difference in growth in numbers. This might be misleading as the user might think that there has been a sudden spike when they compare the first two bars. In addition to that, the chart also shows limited data points. It would be helpful to show the spike in numbers from Nov 2019 (when the pandemic started) and Feb 2020 (a few months into the pandemic). This information would also tell the user if there was a sudden surge or if this was a gradual increase.
Somethings about the chart that I wanted to change at this stage are:
1.	Add more data points to show a gradual increase
2.	Represent the timeline on the X-axis to make it easier for the user
3.	Represent depression and anxiety with 2 different colors and represent the third category with the mix of these 2 colors
4.	Shorten the labels to only provide important information
5.	Remove the unwanted text from the chart
6.	Change the title to not seem like the pandemic is the sole cause 

### Updated Visualization
The graph below displays the same information as the previous graph, in a different layout.

</div>

#### Changes incorporated
Some of the changes incorportaed in the above vizualization are:
1. I changed the visualization from bar chart to a line chart to show the change over time. 
2. Each color distinctly represents a particular issue. This makes it easier for the user to understand the chart. 
3. The X-axis represents the timeline as opposed to the previous chart which had title.
4. This chart represents data consistently. It also has data from months before the pandemic to support the objective of the chart.
5. I have included an annotation at Dec-19 to show the exact point when the pandemic started to make it easier for the user to read the graph as "Before Covid" and "After Covid".
6. I've updated the title of the chart to ensure that it doesn't sound like the Covid is the only reason for the change in numbers.
7. I've removed most of the extra text from the chart and only provided the source of the data. All the omitted information is available in the source. 
8. I moved the legend to the right of the chart to reduce the time the user spends seeing the chart and then looking at the legend.

#### Test Feedback
I tested the updated visualization with a few of my friends and this is the feedback I received:
1. The third section seems like a total but it's a little confusing what "Anxiety or Depressive Disorder" means.
2. It would be nice if I could see data from before 2019 as well to see how the trend lines were before Covid.
3. The "Covid-19 outbreak" distinction looks like the X-axis, I did not see the left side of the graph because of that. 
4. The legand has too many words.

### Final Visualization
The graph below is similar to the previous visualization, with a few updates.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8628385"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Changes incorporated
Some of the changes incorportaed in the above vizualization are:
1. Updated the title of the "Anxiety or Depressive Disorder" to "Total"
2. Included a few more data points before 2019.
3. Changed the color of the "Covid-19 outbreak" distinction to a light grey and made it a dashed line to ensure that it doesn't get confused with the X-axis
4. Updated the color of the "Total" trend line to grey to draw attention to the other 2 trend lines.


### Final Evaluated
I presented the final visualization to my peers for feedback and received the following comments:
1. The new chart is much easier to understand.
2. The visualization is clean and simple. 
3. I don't need any more information to understand the chart.
