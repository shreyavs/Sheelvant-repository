# About me
Hi! I'm Shreya Sheelvant, I use ‘she/her’ pronouns. I am from Bangalore, India, and in my last semester of the MISM course. As an aspiring Product Manager, I consider myself a fulcrum between business processes and engineering, aiming to build deeply impactful products.
My interest in Product Management started when I joined Deloitte USI. I worked with a cross-functional team for a B2B client where I shadowed the team of Business Analysts and Product Managers. As a result, I had the opportunity to learn about the Product Development Lifecycle and interact with designers and quality assurance personnel. This experience taught me about a Product Manager's day-to-day responsibilities and helped build my design and testing skills. At CMU, I've been cultivating the competencies necessary to be a successful product manager. I've taken courses like Product Management, Business Intelligence, End-to-end Business Analytics, Launching Products, and Human-Computer Interaction where I've worked with a variety of products and clients. During the summer, I worked as a PM intern at IQVIA, the details of which can be found on my resume. Collectively, I can confidently say that I've worked on every facet of product management.

# What I hope to learn
I wish to improve my creative abilities during this course. As a Product Manager, I believe I should be able to sell the product to the customer, and data is a huge part of that. I believe that by taking this course, I will be able to better prepare myself for the future.
