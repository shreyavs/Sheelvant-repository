#### Original Visualization

The following graph depicts the general government debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures the general government's gross debt as a proportion of GDP. We can observe that the graph only shows the debt ratios of various countries for a specific year. The trend in each country's debt-to-GDP ratio can be useful at times, however, this information cannot be inferred from the chart.

#### Updated Visualization 1

I've segmented the previous chart into individual country charts so we can see how each country's debt-to-GDP ratio is changing. This visualization allows us to look back at the previous year's data to be able to generate forecasts for the coming years.

#### Updated Visualization 2

This depiction is identical to the previous one, but instead of a line, each country is represented by an area chart. This emphasizes the seriousness of the problem. The increase in the area corresponding to the amount of growth in the Debt-to-GDP ratio can be seen graphically.
