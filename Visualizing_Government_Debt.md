#### Original Visualization

The following graph depicts the general government debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures the general government's gross debt as a proportion of GDP. We can observe that the graph only shows the debt ratios of various countries for a specific year (2020). The trend in each country's debt-to-GDP ratio can be useful at times, however, this information cannot be inferred from the chart.

#### Updated Visualization 1

I've segmented the previous chart into individual country charts so we can see how each country's debt-to-GDP ratio is changing. This visualization allows us to look back at the previous year's data to be able to generate forecasts for the coming years. We simply need a line plot to see if the trend is going up or down; we don't need a bar chart for this as the excess detail would distract the viewer from the trend.

#### Updated Visualization 2

This depiction is different from the previous one, but instead of a trend analysis, here we are seeing how the Debt-to-GDP ration has increased across counrties over the years.  This emphasizes the seriousness of the problem. The size of the dot increases in proportion to the amount of growth in the Debt-to-GDP ratio, visually conveying the chart's goal to the observer.
