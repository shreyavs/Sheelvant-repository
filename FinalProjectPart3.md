## PART 3

#### Storyboard
<a href = 'https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/india-s-medical-education-has-to-be-reformed/index.html'>Shorthand</a>

#### Part 1 Brief
In part 1, I started with the topic "Education in India," with the intention of drawing attention to the differences in educational systems in India. I intended to include information on job rates and earnings after graduation, educational systems in other countries, the diverse skills of students, as well as information on the reasons for this, social expectations, and long-term trends. I intended to persuade the audience of the value of diverse career pathways and educational programs in the call to action section. In phase one of the project, I gathered data for the presentation, created and adjusted various story arcs that I wanted to work with. I also created a few rough sketches to show the visualizations that would help the narrative. I also began to experiment with shorthand and flourish graphs, iconography, and other tools that I had access to. Additionally, I worked on understanding the audience by putting down their wants and how my story could meet them.

#### Part 2 Brief
In the second portion of the project, I limited the project's focus to the lack of medical education in India.I changed the story arc and continued to look for fresh datasets that would help me tell the story. I began preparing the storyboard and charts after I collected all of the material. Once I had a rough draft ready, I conducted user research interviews. For the user research, I created a user research protocol that included the questions I wanted to ask, the questions I wanted to be answered, the goal of the interview, and other details. I focused on evaluating who I wanted to interview, how I would contact them, and other details. I conducted a total of 4 research interviews. My research interviews helped shed light on certain elements of the story that I had overlooked. I even received some helpful feedback on the narrative and visualizations.

#### Part 3 Summary
In the third phase of the project, I worked on developing the storyboard based on feedback from my user interviews. I began by making basic design modifications, such as adding a heading to each block of text. I also reorganized the content related to before and after COVID. I included some new sections with visualizations that addressed the cost of medical education in India, the number of students admitted, and so on. I also expanded on my call to action. Based on my interviews, I concluded that my call to action was adequately powerful. As a result, in the third part of the project, I conducted more studies on how the government may improve the status of medical education in India. I discovered facts and infographics indicating that India spends around 3% of its GDP on healthcare. I also included a chart comparing India to other nations in order to urge the audience to invest more in healthcare. While restructuring the storyboard, I also deleted a few sections that I felt didn't add value to the context, such as the new articles about doctor attacks. Although I had hoped that these sections would assist the audience in emotionally engaging with the presentation, based on my interview observations, I realized that they just diverted the user's focus away from the primary topic.

#### Target Audience
The target audience for my project is government officials and policymakers in charge of allocating funds to educational programs. My major focus is on officials in the healthcare and education departments. The majority of the material I found on government websites was quite mundane and had a lot of text. That's why I chose to keep the text on the storyboard to a minimum and instead focus on visualizations and news articles. The storyboard contained a segment on the 'Effects of COVID 19' in Part 2 that featured social media posts. However, after additional consideration, I decided that integrating news articles would enhance the story's impact. I also presented the majority of the facts from a global viewpoint to help the government official in determining India's position. I hoped that by doing so, they would have a better understanding of the gravity of the situation.

#### Datasets
Here are some of the datasets I used for the different visualizations:
<ol>
  <li><a href='https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS?end=2019&name_desc=false&start=2000'>Health Expenditure (% of GDP)</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://www.shiksha.com/medicine-health-sciences/colleges/colleges-india?uaf[]=base_course&rf=filters'>Numer of Universities in India</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/health-workforce'>Doctor Population Ratio</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://www.ghsindex.org/'>Healthcare Access and Quality Index</a></li>
</ol>

#### Further Changes
If I were to continue working on the project, the following are some of the adjustments I would make:
<ol>
  <li>I'd work on the narrative more to make it more succinct.</li>
  <li>I would change the story arc. The story's structure may yet be improved to captivate the audience.</li>
  <li>I'd search for further information on the quality of medical education in India.</li>
  <li>I'd work on the storyboard's theme. I attempted to maintain the theme by utilizing dull images and red highlighted text, however, I believe the storyboard can be better illustrated.</li>\
  <li>I'd experiment with different forms of visualizations to represent data. I'm currently using simple charts, which I believe can be improved.</li>
</ol>

#### Final thoughts
Overall, I believe I was effective in developing the storyboard through the use of study-building techniques, user interviews, and peer reviews. The feedback I received after presenting it to a variety of audiences helped me see it in a new light. It was thrilling to watch the entire story come together after several iterations.
