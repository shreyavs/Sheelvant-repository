## FINAL PROJECT OVERVIEW

#### Updates
In the second phase of my project, I narrowed the project's focus to lack of medical education in India.

#### Understanding the Audience
<p>My final project's target audience has been narrowed down to government officials and policymakers in charge of allocating funds to educational programs. The user's requirements and how they can be met are outlined below.</p>
<p>As a government official, I want to improve India's healthcare system and reduce doctors' workloads so that Indian citizens have access to quality healthcare. I can accomplish this by increasing the number of colleges that offer medical degrees.</p>

#### Story Structure
I've broken down the story into the following sections:
<ol>
  <li>Lack of doctors - I will discuss the WHO norm for doctor-to-population ratios and give a brief overview of India's ratio.</li>
  <li>Comparison of healthcare indices from other countries - I'll show heatmaps of the WHO ratio and the Healthcare Access Index to demonstrate how underequipped the Indian Healthcare System is.</li>
  <li>Impact of Covid-19 - I'll include a few social media posts about doctor-related events that occurred in India. I've chosen to show this through social media posts because I want to show actual images of the events and shed light on the public's voice.</li>
  <li>Reasons for a lack of doctors - There are some obvious reasons for the inefficiency of the Indian healthcare system, such as overpopulation, a lack of manpower, and so on. I'll go over them briefly.</li>
  <li>What changes can be made - While not all of the causes of failure can be addressed, I will discuss how we can increase the number of medical colleges in order to increase the number of doctors. To back up my claim, I'll include a chart showing the percentage of students who take the medical exam in India and how many are admitted, as well as another chart showing the number of colleges dedicated to other fields of study in comparison to medicine. </li>
</ol>


#### Wireframes and storyboards
I've used Shorthand, Unsplash, Pexels, Flourish, and the Noun Project tools to create the storyboard. A rough draft of the storyboard is available here: https://preview.shorthand.com/pH0OViyrAkn5ThZw?_gl=1*1brous5*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDU0MDMxNjkuQ2p3S0NBaUE2c2VRQmhBZkVpd0F2UHF1MTVudkh1R0pYMFlKRUFTQUl2cE4ySV83UTU2LXlyLUVqLUJ2aUpEakVrTmdROGlUZHlLekRob0NpdGdRQXZEX0J3RQ..
<br />
I created the storyboard in Shorthand so that I could easily showcase the story during user interviews without needing to explain it. <br />

#### User Research and Interviews
##### Target Audiencce
The target audiance for my project are government officials and policymakers in charge of allocating funds to educational programs. <br />
##### Approach
I chose to interview people who were involved in the story because I didn't know any government officials and wasn't sure if any government officials would be willing to participate in this interview. I wanted to interview four people: one doctor, one aspiring medical student, one person who has used the healthcare system in an urban setting, and one person who has used the healthcare system in a rural setting. I chose these specific groups of people because I wanted to validate my claim that doctors are overburdened and in need of assistance, I wanted to find evidence that there is a need for more medical colleges/seats, and I also wanted to see how the issue was perceived based on where the person lived and their socio economic background. Because I'm talking about India as a whole, I wanted to make sure that these people came from all over the country. 
To help find people who fall into these categories I asked a few of my friends if they had any relatives or friends in India who might be interested in participating in the study. Fortunately, one of my roommate's aunts is a doctor and was willing to assist; the other three people were easier to find. <br />
##### User Research Protocol
Here are some of the things I hope to find during the interviews:
<ul>
  <li>Does the title provide enough context?</li>
  <li>Is the user able to understand the mood of the presentation from the pictures?</li>
  <li>Are there any areas of improvement?</li>
  <li>Are the included charts enough to support the claim?</li>
  <li>Is there a flow to the presentation?</li>
  <li>Are the social media posts serving the purpose?</li>
  <li>Are there any major elements missing?</li>
  <li>Does something need to be removed from the presentation?</li>
  <li>Did the user need any explanation to understand the presentation?</li>
  <li>Based on the user's prior knowledge of the subject, did they feel more passionately about the topic, less passionately about the topic or retained their emotions?</li>
</ul>

##### Interview Script
This is the basic interview question list I put together. I altered it to be more conversational based on the interviewee's responses. <br />
On Slide 1:
<ol>
  <li>What do you think the goal of this presentation is based on the first slide?</li>
  <li>What do you think the story's mood is based on aesthetics?</li>
  <li>Is this topic something you are aware of or passionate about?</li>
</ol>
<br />
After viewing the storyboard
<ol>
  <li>What did you like about the presentation?</li>
  <li>What did you dislike about the presentation?</li>
  <li>What do you think of the visualizations?</li>
  <li>Was the flow of the presentation smooth?</li>
  <li>Were you able to easily understand all of the slides?</li>
  <li>What were your thoughts on the social media posts?</li>
  <li>Was the data sufficient to prove the need for medical colleges/seats?</li>
  <li>What would you have done differently on the presentation</li>
  <li>What would you add to or remove from the presentation</li>
  <li>What are your final thought about the presentation?</li>

</ul>
Constructive Feedback
<ul>

  <li>3/4 interviewees said they didn't understand what the Instagram posts meant or why they were there. "I would add some heading to the posts, I wasn't able to understand the meaning of posts at first" - Interviewee 1</li>
  <li>1/4 users said they were intrigued by the topic but didn't find it compelling. "It makes me wonder about why our country is doing this bad, but I'm not very emotionally intrigued by it."</li>
  <li>1/4 interviewees said they would like information about management quote in medical colleges</li>
  <li>1/4 interviewees said adding specific data saying before and after Covid will help. "The presentation seems a little disconnected, you have a section about Covid, what about before Covid, how was it then?" - Interviewee 1</li>
</ul>
Other observations:
<ul>
  <li>4/4 interviewees missed the text in-between the Instagram posts, they thought there was no explanation for them and they were stand alone posts</li>

</ol>

##### Steps to incorporate feedback
Here are a few steps I will be taking to incorporate the feedback I have received.
<ol>
  <li>I will be adding more data linking the issue of shortage of doctors with a lack of medical colleges. This will include statistics about brain-draining, other country medical colleges, cost of medical schooling in other countries, cost management quota for medical seats, etc.</li>
  <li>I will redo the Covid-19 impact section. I will clearly state how the situation was before Covid and then how it is after Covid. I'll change the layout of the section including Instagram posts.</li>
  <li>I'll look for ways to make the story more emotionally compelling, I'll talk to my peers and do some research on strategies that I can use.</li>
  <li>I'll add descriptive text which includes all the topics I explained to the interviewees so that the presentation can be a standalone product.</li>
</ol>

##### Final thoughts
Overall, I had a great time with the feedback process. I received a lot of constructive criticism and identified the specific issues that needed to be addressed. It was interesting to present my work in front of an audience.
